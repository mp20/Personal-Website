          Why, hello there! I&apos;m a software engineer, currently studying
          computer science at <span className="ga-tech">Georgia Tech</span>. My
          journey is all about merging my love for tech with a desire to make a
          real difference in society. It&apos;s not just about coding for me;
          it&apos;s about creating solutions that people truly need and
          appreciate. I&apos;ve been in the deep ends of both frontend and
          backend development, thanks to a couple of cool projects I got to
          lead. Namely, &quot;Spasli&quot;, a peer to peer rental marketplace
          which I cofounded, and a campus event app that really brought our
          school community together.
